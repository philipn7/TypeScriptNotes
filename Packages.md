## Type Definition File
TypeScript needs to know the type of objects. Type definition files provide that information for JavaScript modules. 

* Sometimes when importing JavaScript modules the type definition file is not included. Can usually be installed manually through DefinitelyTyped. Example: `npm install @types/faker`.

### Reading typescript definition files
In VS Code, hold ctrl and click on the object to bring up its typescript definition. 
> "This is like half the power of typescript right here reading these different types and using some little hints inside of here to understand how these libraries work."

* Collapse methods to make the file easier to read. Bring up the palette (ctrl+shift+P) and type 'fold level 2'
